# ARIMA(p, d, q)
# Diagnostic ratio - UMCSI:VIX
#
# This script evaluates a grid of ARIMA(p,d,q) models using a leakage-safe,
# expanding-window rolling forecast setup, and reports forecast accuracy metrics
# (MSE/RMSE/MAE) on the held-out test period for horizons h = 1 and h = 3.
#
# There are THREE nested "loops", implemented functionally (purrr) instead of for-loops:
#   (1) model grid loop   : iterate over each (p,d,q) in arima_grid
#   (2) horizon loop      : iterate over each h in h_list
#   (3) time/rolling loop : iterate over each timestamp k inside test split
#
# Leakage safety rule:
#   For a target observation at time t (the split row k), the forecast "origin"
#   is set to t - h, so the model is fit only on data up through t - h (never t).
